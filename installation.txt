I. Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------
PHP 5.1.x or greater
	This application uses the new SPL interfaces for PHP that are
only available on PHP 5.1 or later

PHP must be compiled with support for:
	LDAP
	MySQL
	PDO

	Actually, you can substitute any database support for MySQL, as this
framework uses PDO for database interaction.  Also, LDAP is only used for
for doing LDAP authentication for users.  If you're not going to do any
LDAP authentication, you can delete or comment out the LDAP stuff.

This application was written assuming you have control over your own web
server.  If you are on a hosted system, you may need to make changes to
the code to accomodate your server.

All include files have been kept out of the web directory, and a configuration
file has been included. You will need to make sure that every .php script
in the HTML directory includes configuration.inc.  If you control your own
webserver, you can add a <Directory> command to your httpd.conf, otherwise
you will need to add a include() command to the top of every .php script in
the HTML directory.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
II. php.ini settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	This application has been written to conform to E_STRICT error
reporting.  However, it does rely on some specific php.ini settings.

output_buffering  = 4096
	There are many places where we do redirects after some content
	has been written.  For instance, Find forms tend to redirect
	to a view page if they find only one result.

arg_separator.output = ";"
arg_separator.input = ";&"
	In order to be fully standards comliant, urls must be marked up
	using a semicolon instead of the traditional ampersand.  However,
	browsers still use the ampersand when submitting forms via GET,
	so we have to allow for it.


session.use_cookies = 1
session.use_only_cookies = 1
	We don't want our sessions to be hijacked, so they're not passed
	in the url at all.  All sessions will be cookie-based, and only
	cookie-based.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	The best way is to have PHP auto_prepend the configuration.inc.
If this is the only web application on your apache server, you can just point
your apache's web directory to the html directory inside the application and
edit the auto_prepend in your php.ini file.

	For us, we're running multiple applications, and have a seperate entry in
our Apache config for each one.  This does essentially the same thing.

Add to httpd.conf:

Alias /application_name "/var/www/sites/application_name/html"
<Directory "/var/www/sites/application_name/html">
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

        php_value auto_prepend_file /var/www/sites/application_name/configuration.inc
</Directory>
